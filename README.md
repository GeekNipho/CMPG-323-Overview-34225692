# CMPG-323-Overview-34225692

The use of the .gitignore file within each project is to prevent git from tracking certain files and rather ignore them from local or remote repository. 

##Branching Strategies \n
Project 1 consists of only the main branch as the overview repository in which the progress of the other projects will be tracked.
Project 2. 3, 4 amd 5 will contain the the main branches describing the context of the projects and will each most likely have "Stakeholder" branches detailing how to use the report of the projects.
